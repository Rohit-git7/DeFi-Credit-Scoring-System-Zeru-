# DeFi-Credit-Scoring-System-Zeru-
DeFi Credit Scoring System - The goal is to develop a robust machine learning model that assigns a credit score between 0 and 1000 to each wallet, based solely on historical transaction behavior. Higher scores indicate reliable and responsible usage; lower scores reflect risky, bot-like, or exploitative behavior.



Based on the analysis report provided, here's the filled-in analysis.md with the actual data:

### Key Findings

1. **Average Credit Score**: 624.3 points
2. **Score Standard Deviation**: 63.3 points
3. **Median Score**: 605.7 points
4. **Mode Category**: Good (Moderate Risk) - 68.52% of wallets fall in 600-700 range

## Component Score Analysis

## Behavioral Analysis by Score Range

### High Scorers (700-800) - Excellent Credit

**Characteristics (Based on Actual Data):**
- **Repayment Behavior**: Extremely high repayment ratios (average 5,970,772,443.58 indicating over-collateralization)
- **Utilization Patterns**: Conservative borrowing (average 0.23 utilization ratio)
- **Transaction Frequency**: Above average activity (42.1 transactions per wallet)
- **Asset Diversity**: Higher engagement with multiple assets
- **Risk Management**: Perfect liquidation history (0% liquidation rate)
- **Activity Longevity**: Accounts active for 31 days on average

**Typical Profile:**
- Average transactions: 42.1 per wallet
- Average account age: 31 days
- Liquidation rate: 0%
- Bot-like behavior: Virtually none (0.000 avg bot score)

**Business Implications:**
- Lowest default risk with perfect liquidation record
- Suitable for premium rates and higher credit limits
- Ideal candidates for unsecured lending

### Medium Scorers (500-699) - Good to Fair Credit

**Characteristics (Based on Actual Data):**
- **Repayment Behavior**: Moderate repayment patterns (0.13 average ratio for 400-699 range)
- **Utilization Patterns**: Highly variable, with some extreme outliers in lower ranges
- **Transaction Frequency**: Standard activity (26.3 transactions average)
- **Risk Events**: No liquidation history observed
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Minimal automated activity (0.012 avg bot score)

**Typical Profile:**
- Average transactions: 26.3 per wallet
- Average account age: 21 days
- Liquidation rate: 0%
- Low bot detection rate (1.1-4.0% depending on sub-range)

**Business Implications:**
- Standard lending rates appropriate
- Regular monitoring recommended for utilization spikes
- Suitable for collateralized lending

### Low Scorers (300-500) - Poor to Very Poor Credit

**Characteristics (Based on Actual Data):**
- **Repayment Issues**: Very poor repayment history (0.00 ratio for <400 range)
- **High Utilization**: Extremely high utilization ratios (averaging in trillions, indicating calculation errors or extreme over-leverage)
- **Liquidation History**: Surprisingly, 0% liquidation rate despite poor scores
- **Bot-like Behavior**: Minimal bot detection (0.0% for lowest tier)
- **Account Maturity**: Paradoxically longer account age (52 days average for <400 range)

**Typical Profile:**
- Average transactions: 32.3 per wallet (higher than medium scorers)
- High utilization rates (100% for ranges 300-500)
- No liquidation events recorded
- Minimal bot-like behavior scores

**Business Implications:**
- High default risk despite lack of liquidation events
- Avoid unsecured lending
- Require maximum collateral ratios
- May indicate data quality issues requiring investigation

## Risk Pattern Analysis

### Liquidation Risk Indicators

**Surprising Findings:**
- **0% liquidation rate** across ALL score ranges, indicating either:
  - Very recent data with insufficient time for liquidations
  - Data quality issues in liquidation event capture
  - Extremely conservative user behavior in this dataset

### Bot Detection Insights

**Identified patterns:**
- **Very Low Bot Activity**: Maximum 4.0% bot detection rate in 500-600 range
- **Clean High Scorers**: 0% bot detection in highest score ranges
- **Concentrated Detection**: Bot activity primarily in middle-score ranges (500-600)

### Utilization Risk Patterns

**Critical Observations:**
- **Extreme Utilization Values**: Ratios in trillions for low-score ranges suggest data normalization issues
- **Healthy High Scorers**: Utilization ratios 0.23-0.52 for scores 700+
- **100% High Utilization Rate**: All wallets in 300-500 range flagged for high utilization

## Data Quality Concerns

### Identified Issues
1. **Utilization Calculation Anomalies**: Extreme values suggest normalization problems
2. **Repayment Ratio Outliers**: Values over 5 billion indicate calculation errors
3. **Zero Liquidation Events**: Unusual for DeFi dataset, needs investigation
4. **Short Account Ages**: Average 21-52 days suggests recent protocol or data collection period

## Recommendations

### For Lending Protocols

1. **Tier 1 (700-800 Score)**: 479 wallets (13.7%) - Premium tier with enhanced limits
2. **Tier 2 (600-699)**: 2,396 wallets (68.5%) - Standard tier, backbone of portfolio
3. **Tier 3 (500-599)**: 476 wallets (13.6%) - Cautious lending with higher collateral
4. **Tier 4 (<500)**: 146 wallets (4.2%) - Restricted access, investigate data anomalies

### For Data Quality

1. **Immediate Review**: Investigate utilization and repayment ratio calculations
2. **Liquidation Event Capture**: Verify liquidation detection methodology
3. **Amount Normalization**: Review token decimal handling and amount conversions
4. **Historical Validation**: Cross-reference with known liquidation events

### For Risk Management

1. **Conservative Approach**: Given data anomalies, apply higher safety margins
2. **Manual Review**: Flag extreme utilization ratios for individual assessment
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Start with high-score segment while refining calculations
4. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time tracking of key metrics and anomalies

## Model Performance Assessment

### Current Limitations
- **Data Recency**: Short observation period (21-52 day average account age)
- **Missing Liquidations**: 0% rate suggests incomplete event capture
- **Calculation Errors**: Extreme values in key metrics require correction

### Validation Metrics
- **Score Distribution**: Reasonable bell curve around 624 points
- **Risk Segmentation**: Clear separation between tiers
- **Component Balance**: Well-distributed contributions across scoring components
